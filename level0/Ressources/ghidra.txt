Ghidra analysis notes â€” level0

1. Main function:

- The program calls atoi on argv[1]
- Compares the result with 0x1a7
- If yes:
    - strdup("/bin/sh")
    - setresuid(geteuid())
    - setresgid(getegid())
    - execv("/bin/sh")

2. Output:
   If you pass "423", the program will give you a shell as the binary's owner.
